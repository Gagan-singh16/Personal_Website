    <h1>How to Value a Stock in Volatile Markets</h1>

    <h2>📉 The Challenge of Volatility</h2>
    <p>In volatile markets, traditional valuation methods can yield misleading results. Price swings distort P/E ratios,
      and news-driven moves obscure long-term value. As analysts, we need tools that cut through the noise.
    </p>

    <h2>📊 Using DCF for Clarity</h2>
    <p>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) remains one of the most robust ways to understand intrinsic value. By projecting
      future cash flows and discounting them back to present value, we create an anchor in a sea of speculation.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Assumptions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue Growth: 8% CAGR for next 5 years</li>
      <li>WACC: 10%</li>
      <li>Terminal Growth Rate: 3%</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📈 Peer Comparison as a Sanity Check</h2>
    <p>Alongside DCF, comparing with similar companies helps validate our assumptions. But in high volatility, ensure
      the comps are not mispriced themselves.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>In fast-changing markets, it's not just about the numbers — it’s about narrative conviction. Stay grounded in
      fundamentals, but agile in thinking.
